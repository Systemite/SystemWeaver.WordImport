# SystemWeaver Word importer demo

This demo shows how to create a simple Word importer. 

There is often a need to import information from a Word document into SystemWeaver. This program reads a Word document and creates a hierarchy of sections in SystemWeaver that corresponds to the headings of the Word document. The body text of a heading is imported to the description of the SystemWeaver section.

## Building

To build this project you need to get the SystemWeaverClientAPI.dll and put it in the Imported directory. This file is provided by Systemite if you want to start developing on the SystemWeaver platform.
